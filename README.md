# jQuery WAI-ARIA

This is a jQuery plugin that adds methods for manipulating WAI-ARIA methods. Unlike other plugins that do similar things, this plugin has been designed to match jQuery's style making it much easier to pick up. The plugin includes:

- `.aria()` for getting and setting WAI-ARIA attributes.
- `.ariaRef()` for getting and setting references to other elements.
- `.ariaState()` for getting and setting states.
- `.removeAria()`, `.removeAriaRef()` and `.removeAriaState()` for removing WAI-ARIA methods.
- `.ariaVisible()` and `.ariaFocusable()` for toggling common features.
- `.identify()` for generating element IDs as necessary.
- `.role()` and `.removeRole()` for handling WAI-ARIA landmarks.
- `jQuery.normaliseAria()` and `jQuery.normalizeAria()` for simplifying the WAI-ARIA attributes.
